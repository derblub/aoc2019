# Advent of Code 2019

My attempts at solving the daily coding challenges of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## random language picker
Since it looks pretty much like I'm going to use a different language each day, I made a small script to help my daily struggle to decide the programming langauge of the day.  
**Exceptions:** I'm going to use python, in case the problem input requires to parse int-code, since I'm loosing too much time to figure out, how to include my int-code parser in python to _x_ or re-implement the int-code parser in _x_.
