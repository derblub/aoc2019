# Advent of Code 2019

My attempts at solving the daily coding challenges of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## random language picker
Since it looks pretty much like I'm going to use a different language each day, I made a small script to help my daily struggle to decide the programming langauge of the day. Now I just need to fill it with 20 more languages > WIP.

## completed days

| day    | done in language    |
|--------|---------------------|
| day 01 | python              |
| day 02 | bash                |
| day 03 | javascript          |
| day 04 | php                 |
