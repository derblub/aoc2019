# Advent of Code 2019

My attempts at solving the daily coding challenges of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## random language picker
Since it looks pretty much like I'm going to use a different language each day, I made a small script to help my daily struggle to decide the programming langauge of the day.
